    <h1>International student migration around the world - origins and destinations</h1>
    <p>by Ta Quang Tung, Nguyen Quang Huy</p>
    <p>Thanks to greater economic prosperity and the convenience of international travel, people are becoming more
        mobile than before. No longer are people tied down to their country of origin - they can now travel the world to
        look for a better life in other countries. Among these migrants, many leave their homes in search of better
        educational opportunities. Between 2017 and 2021, an estimated 30 million people migrated to study overseas.
        These international students play an important cultural and socio-economic role in the places they arrive at.
        This visualization project aims to give readers an overview of international student migration by looking at
        where these students came from and where they headed.</p>
